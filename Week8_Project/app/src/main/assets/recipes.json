      "description": "In the 1970s, public art underwent a huge period of upheaval. Various urban regeneration programs around the world were established that provided funding for artists to make experimental, accessible artworks that connected to a spirit of place, as both temporary and permanent projects.\n\nArtists at this time were increasingly experimenting with art made beyond the confines of the gallery, with many finding ways to create outdoor sculptures or immersive environments, such as moving, kinetic sculptures and fragile, impermanent interventions. George Rickey and Anthony Howe’s wind powered, kinetic art sculptures are powerful feats of engineering that are still standing strong today.",

      "description": "Public art today is still a prominent and popular art form, appearing in places as diverse as urban centers, plazas, pedestrian areas, squares, and thoroughfares, in indoor and outdoor settings.\n\nSome of the most daring examples of today include Anish Kapoor’s giant, reflective Cloud Gate at the AT&T Plaza at Millenium Park in Chicago and David Cerny’s kinetic sculpture Metalmorphosis, a vast, mechanical head that splinters and fragments as it rotates through time and space.\n\nSculptor Anthony Gormley has created a range of figurative public sculptures across the UK including his iconic Angel of the North, 1988 in Gateshead, situated on the side of a public motorway which has become a powerful symbol of national pride.",

      "description": "\u200BPublic art sculptures and installations can also often be found in unconventional or remote areas, such as Walter de Maria’s Lightning Field, 1977, which aims to capture the natural power of lightning in a remote desert in New Mexico and Ugo Rondinone’s Seven Magic Mountains, a series of eye-poppingly bright standing stones in the Nevada desert.\n\n\u200BOther public art installations and sculptures appear as a part of huge, temporary festivals and events, as seen in Burning Man. More temporal forms of public art such as graffiti, fireworks and holograms are also immensely popular among artists and audiences today.",
